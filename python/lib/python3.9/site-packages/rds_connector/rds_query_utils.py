This Python script encompasses utility functions specifically designed to process query results from the 
Tidal Basin PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS. These functions are integral components of the rds_processor.py file.


Functions:

    - rds_sql_pull(cursor, query): 
      Executes a SQL query using the provided cursor, fetches rows, and converts them to a Pandas DataFrame.

    - build_clean_list(join_list): 
      Builds a list of cleaning steps based on the join list provided. 
      
    - build_schema(source=None, join_list=None, schema=None, exclude=None): 
      Constructs a schema list from the source and join list, optionally excluding specified fields. 
      
    - build_query(source=None, join_list=None, query=None): 
      Constructs a SQL query from the source and join list. 
      
    - clean_empty_none(field, df, removed): 
      Cleans rows with empty or None values from the specified field in the DataFrame. 
      
    - convert_dates(field, df, output_format=None): 
      Converts string dates in the specified field to datetime objects in the DataFrame. 
      
    - convert_integer(field, df): 
      Converts string numbers in the specified field to integers in the DataFrame. 
      
    - update_field_names(self, table_fields, new_fields): 
      Updates column names in the DataFrame based on user-provided lists of current and new field names.

def rds_sql_pull(cursor, query):

    """
    Executes a SQL query using the provided cursor, fetches rows, and converts them to a Pandas DataFrame.

    Parameters:
    - cursor: Cursor object for database connection.
    - query: SQL query string to be executed.

    Explanation:
    This function attempts to execute a SQL query using the given cursor. It fetches all rows from the query result 
    and then converts these rows into a Pandas DataFrame. If the conversion to a DataFrame fails, an exception is raised, 
    and the process is stopped to indicate the failure. The function ensures that the SQL query is executed 
    and its results are correctly transformed into a DataFrame format for further data manipulation or analysis.

    Return:
    The DataFrame containing the query results if successful.

    Note:
    Any failure in executing the query or converting the result to a DataFrame triggers an exception, 
    alerting the user to address the issue promptly.

    Parameters:
    -----------

    --------

        A tuple containing the source component and the join list component.

    Raises:

    Exception

    Explanation:
    ------------
    This function checks if the `query_package` is not None and then attempts to extract the 'source' and 'join_list' components from it. 
    If either component is missing, an exception is raised indicating the specific missing component. If the `query_package` is None, 
    both the source and join list are set to None. The function ensures that the necessary components are present for further processing

    It then iterates through the provided join list, extracting the fields and their cleaning operations. 
    For each operation, it attempts to match it with a function from the cleaning dictionary and adds it to the clean list.
